    <h1>The Croissant’s Crescent</h1>
    <p>
      During the 17th-century siege of Vienna, a baker named Lukas stayed up
      late preparing dough. One night, he heard strange noises beneath his
      shop—Ottoman soldiers tunneling under the city.
      <br />
      He warned the guards, saving Vienna from invasion.
      <br />
      To celebrate, Lukas baked a pastry shaped like the enemy’s crescent moon—a
      buttery symbol of victory. The croissant was born: flaky, golden, and
      defiant.
